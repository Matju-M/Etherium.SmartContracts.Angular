# Online MarketPlace

This solution creates an online marketplace that operates on the etherium blockchain. An administrator (the user the deployed the smart contract)
is able to add store owners. These store owners in turn can add new stores, while also create products in those stores.
Shoppers then can visit the stores and purchase goods.
